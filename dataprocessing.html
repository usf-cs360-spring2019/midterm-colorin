      <h3>Data</h3>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3">Fire Department Calls for Service</a> is a public
        dataset from the city of San Francisco that logs all the responses to calls received by the fire department.
        The data contains detailed information about the time interval of each call logged, therefore multiple records might be found for a call number.
        Besides the time interval, each record contains call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type, call type group and disposition.
        <br/><br/>
        The dataset contains approximately 4,897,527 rows in total, therefore we will be working with a subset. Since our goal is to identify the incidents
        happened during the wildfire season in California, we'll be looking at the calls made during the months of September to November of the past 5 years (2014-2018)
        which comprises 378,816 rows. The dataset has 34 columns, we will consider some of them to create our prototypes and visualizations.
        <br/><br/>
        For more information about our choice of subset, see the <a href="./index.html#description">Project Description</a> section on the Home Page.
      </p>

      <h3>Processing</h3>

      <p>
        As mentioned before, the first step for processing the data was to filter it and only look at the months of September, October and November for the years
        of 2014-2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do have a few prototypes that are using all the records from the last 5 years (2014-2018), but they are only to explain the context of our topic (and dataset)
        among the rest of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some of our visualization, we calculated certain fields. First, to obtain the "Avg. Time To Send Response", we took the minute difference between the "Received Datetime"
        and the "Dispatched Datetime" columns. We would have liked to use the "On Scene Datetime" column, but its values were mostly null. Furthermore, to distinguish between
        "Fire-Related" calls and "Non-Fire-Related" calls, we simply used the "Call Final Disposition" column, where a "Fire" value mapped to a "Fire-Related" call and all other values
        mapped to "Non-Fire-Related" calls.
