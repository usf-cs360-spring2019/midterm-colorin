      <h3>Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        The idea behind this visualization is to look at the trends (peaks and lows) in the number of calls through the months of the last 5 years.
        We can change between three different "views", each with a different purpose. The views are:
        <li>Total Number of Calls Through the Years 2014-2018 by Month
          <ul>
            This graph aims to show the total number of calls made to the SF Fire Department for the last 5 years, divided by month.
            Here we can see that, even though there is a "peak" during the months of September-November, it is not the time of the year
            with the most calls. Our focus is to deal with "fire-relatetd" calls, however, this graph does not differentiate between "fire-related"
            calls and "non-fire-related" calls (such as Medical Emergencies), therefore we decided to show a view of "fire-related" calls.
          </ul>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Number of Fire-Related Calls Through the Years 2014-2018 by Month
          <ul>
            This graph shows only the "fire-related" calls. It is useful to see that there is actually a peak of "fire-related" calls during
            the summer months (May to August), specially June. It would make sense, given that summer is when the highest temperatures are recorded
            and therefore can contribute to fires.
          </ul>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Number of Calls with a 'Fire' Call Final Disposition Code Through Years 2014-2018 by Month
          <ul>
            This graph shows a different "fire-related" calls using the code given to the call when disposing. It is still fairly similar to the
            the second graph above, but they are not exactly the same. We tried looking for more information to understand the discrepancy, but
            could not really find a satisfactory reason. In this graph we can also see there is a peak during the summer months.
          </ul>
          <br>
        </li>
      </p>

      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>
        Challenges that happened were trying to make the changing of the views have a better transition. In the end, adding transition when changing the
        different views seemed a little confusing and the more straightforward change seemed better.

        For the interactivity (change between different charts), I used the following examples:
